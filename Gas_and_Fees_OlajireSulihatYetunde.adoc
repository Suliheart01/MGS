1. What is Gas?

Gas is like the fuel for doing things on the Ethereum network.
Just like cars need petrol to move, Ethereum needs gas to do things like send money, run apps, or swap tokens.



2. What is the Purpose of Gas in Ethereum Transactions?

Gas is used to pay the computers (called nodes) that help run the Ethereum network.
When you send a transaction, like swapping one token for another, you need to pay gas to make it happen.
Without gas, the computers won’t do your job.



3. EIP-1559 How Did It Change Gas Fees?

Before EIP-1559, people had to guess how much gas to pay. If they paid too little, their transaction failed. If they paid too much, they overpaid.

EIP-1559 fixed this by adding three parts

 Base Fee – This is the minimum gas fee everyone must pay. It goes up when the network is busy and down when it's quiet.

 Priority Fee (Tip) – If you want your transaction to go faster, you can add a tip to encourage miners to pick yours first.

Burning – The base fee you pay is burned (destroyed). This makes Ethereum more scarce, like burning money, which can help its value go up.



4. What is Slippage and How Does It Relate to Gas?

 Slippage happens when the price changes between the time you start a transaction and when it finishes.
For example, if you want to swap 1 ETH for 100 tokens, but the price changes quickly, you might get only 95 tokens instead. That’s slippage.

Slippage can get worse when:

The network is very busy (lots of people are using it).

Gas fees are high, and your transaction is delayed.

Many people are trying to do the same swap at once.


So if your gas fee is too low, your transaction might be too slo and slippage might hurt you more.
